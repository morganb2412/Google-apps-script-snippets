Workspace Automation Scripts
 A community-driven collection of Google Apps Script snippets and automation tools designed to save time and boost productivity in Google Workspace.

This repository includes scripts for:

📅 Google Calendar (auto-scheduling tasks, events, and reminders)

📧 Gmail (email filters, auto-labeling, bulk clean-up)

📊 Google Sheets (data automation, logging, reporting)

📂 Google Drive (file organization, auto-sharing)

✨ Current Example: Chapter Scheduling Script
The first script in this repository automatically adds one chapter per day to your Google Calendar. For example, if you’re studying Python Crash Course, you can set the start date and it will schedule each chapter as a daily event until completion.

👉 Perfect for learners who want consistency in their study routine without manually creating calendar events.
